Visit the deployed site: [Bluey!](https://mnevison.github.io/MPDeuce/index.html)

I have young children.. So when I mentioned the possibility of making a memory game, the first thing they suggested was doing one based on Bluey. I went for a very friendly vibe with this site, and tried to contain some useful information about the show and main characters along with a game that can be played for hours (my kids were my primary game testers..).

  ## Design

  ### Colour Scheme

  The colours used across the site are all represented in the main character of the show.. Bluey!. When doing research into the character (that wasn't just my kids telling me about how good the show was..) I came across the official Bluey website [Bluey.tv](https://www.bluey.tv/) where I was able to get a bit of inspiration on the project. This website ended up being VERY useful throughout the project from a design perspective.

  Here are the hex values I used:

  ![colour-scheme](docs\images\colour-scheme.png)

  These were added across the site as custom CSS variables, so if I ever wanted to change the colours it would be a case of changing 3 things rather than going through the whole site where colour is applied.
